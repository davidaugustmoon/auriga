        "It's not fair that they don't let me into the server room\nanymore. You mess up one time! Robo-Bear was a great robot. That\ntech never should have been in the testing hangar while Bear was\nrunning a demolition sequence. Oh well...",
        "They don't let anyone go up to the attic anymore. I'm a little\nscared to even know what's up there.",
        "Did you see the master server!?"
