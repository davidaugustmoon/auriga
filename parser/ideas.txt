Parser will look for phrasal structures like the following:

To act on an object, apply an object to another, or interact with
an entity:
[VERB] [DIRECT OBJECT] [PREPOSITION] [...] [INDIRECT OBJECT]
[VERB] [DIRECT OBJECT]
[VERB] [PREPOSITION] [...] [INDIRECT OBJECT]

To use an exit:
[VERB] [PREPOSITION] [...] [LOCATION]
[VERB] [PREPOSITION] [...] [DIRECTION]
[VERB] [LOCATION]
[VERB] [DIRECTION]
[LOCATION]
[DIRECTION]

* Note that [...] indicates more prepositions.
* Any articles (a, an, the) will be dropped by the parser;
  that is, they will be ignored.
* All user input will be converted to lowercase.
* Constants will be defined, including synonyms.
* Prepositions will likely not have semantic meaning and will be dropped;
  will need input from the team on this.  Another option would be to store
  the prepositions and only look at them in the case of an ambiguous verb
  (e.g. leave room vs. leave on floor).


Possible list of valid verbs (and synonyms):

DROP (DEPOSIT, LEAVE, PUT, SET [DOWN], THROW)
GO ([], 
LISTEN (HEAR)
LOOK (CHECK, INSPECT, VIEW)
LOOSTEN (ADJUST [if tight])
QUIT (BYE, EXIT)
SAVE
TAKE (CLUTCH, GATHER, GRAB, PICK [UP], PILFER, STEAL)
TALK (SAY, SPEAK, TELL)
TIGHTEN (ADJUST [if loose])
WAIT (CHILL, NAP, PAUSE, RELAX, REST, SLEEP)
