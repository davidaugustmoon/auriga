# Auriga
Auriga is a command line text adventure game that was developed for the OSU CS467 Capstone
Course. You begin the game as a robot that mysteriously powered on. You must navigate the
Auriga facility while keeping your batteries charged, and find a way to free yourself from
the corporate shackles. Talk to characters and other robots throughout the game to help
you determine what to do next. Use items to unlock exits, increase your abilities, and
solve puzzles to advance the game.
